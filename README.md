# group-project-2

Title:
MyCryptoLedger

Description:
Our objective for this project is to make a website where you can keep track of all of your cryptocurrencies. Crypto is a growing buisness, with the prices of them changing on a regular basis, as well as new ones popping up every so often. Since most new cryptocurrencies have their own ways of getting stored, it can get tedious for someone investing in many different types to get information on each type of crypto quickly, like how much they have and its current price.

The site works by allowing a user to make a login, and once they're in they'll be able to input what type of cryptocurrency they have, and how much of it. The site will also show them how much each crypto is worth, and the overall value of their portfolio.

Our motivation for this project is to jump on a current money making trend by making a website that makes it easy for anyone to keep track of all of their investments. With all of the new material and systems we've learned over the past couple of months, we decided that a crypto tracking website that remembers a users input and shows their cryto's current value would be perfect.
